# Analysis and Study of the Wikipedia Graph

This project focuses on the topological analysis of a graph derived from Wikipedia. The analyses performed include:

- Creation of directed and undirected graphs from structured datasets.
- Calculation of the following network metrics:
  - Indegree, outdegree, and total degree.
  - Identification of key nodes for each metric.
- Exploration of the graph's topological properties.

## Tools and Libraries
The project leverages the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and graph processing.
- **NetworkX**: For graph creation and manipulation.
- **iGraph**: For advanced graph computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization of graph structures and metrics.
- **Pandas**: For handling tabular data and datasets.
